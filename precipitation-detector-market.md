<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Precipitation Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Weighing</li><li>Tipping Bucket</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Precipitation detectors can be classified into two main types - Weighing and Tipping Bucket. Weighing precipitation detectors measure the weight of the collected precipitation to determine the amount of rain or snowfall. On the other hand, Tipping Bucket detectors work by collecting rain or snow in a funnel, which then tips and empties the water into a container for measurement. Both types of detectors are widely used in meteorological stations and weather monitoring systems to accurately record and track precipitation levels.</p></p>
