<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Subsea Pressure Gauge Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Compensated Model</li><li>Not Compensated Model</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Subsea pressure gauges are available in two main types: compensated model and not compensated model. Compensated models are designed to adjust for changes in temperature and depth, providing accurate pressure readings even in harsh subsea environments. On the other hand, not compensated models do not have this feature, and may be more suitable for simpler applications where temperature and depth variations are not a concern. Each type has its own advantages and is selected based on the specific requirements of the subsea operation.</p></p>
