<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Crude Desalter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Stage Desalter</li><li>Two-stage Desalter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Crude desalters are used in the oil refining process to remove impurities like salts and water from crude oil. There are two main types of crude desalters: single-stage desalters and two-stage desalters. Single-stage desalters involve the oil and water mixing together before entering the desalter, while two-stage desalters separate the oil and water before they are mixed in the desalter. Each type has its advantages and is chosen based on the specific needs of the refinery and the quality of the crude oil being processed.</p></p>
