<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Centrifugal Water Separator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal Version</li><li>Vertical Version</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Centrifugal water separators come in two main types: horizontal version and vertical version. Horizontal version separators are typically more compact and can be easily integrated into existing piping systems. Vertical version separators, on the other hand, are generally used in applications where space is limited and gravity plays a role in separating water from the air stream. Both types of separators are designed to efficiently remove water from compressed air systems, ensuring optimal performance and preventing damage to downstream equipment.</p></p>
