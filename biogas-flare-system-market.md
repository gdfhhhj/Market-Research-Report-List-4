<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biogas Flare System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open System</li><li>Enclosed System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Biogas Flare System Market consists of two main types: Open System and Enclosed System. Open System flares release biogas into the atmosphere, where it is burned off. This type is often used in industries with high biogas production. Enclosed System flares capture and combust biogas within a closed environment, ensuring minimal release of harmful emissions. This type is commonly found in municipal waste treatment facilities and landfills. Both systems are essential for the safe disposal of biogas while preventing harm to the environment.</p></p>
