<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Induced Draft Fan Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial</li><li>Radial</li><li>Centrifugal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Induced draft fans come in three main types: Axial, Radial, and Centrifugal. </p><p>Axial fans move air parallel to the fan's axis, making them ideal for applications requiring high airflow and low pressure. Radial fans, on the other hand, move air perpendicular to the fan's axis, making them suitable for moderate airflow and pressure applications. Centrifugal fans use rotating impellers to increase the velocity of air, making them well-suited for high-pressure applications. Each type of fan has its unique strengths and capabilities, catering to varying industrial needs.</p></p>
