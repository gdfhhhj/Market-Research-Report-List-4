<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle Retarder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electric retarders</li><li>Hydraulic retarder</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vehicle retarders are braking systems used in trucks and other heavy vehicles to assist with slowing down or stopping. Electric retarders use an electric motor to create resistance and slow the vehicle down, while hydraulic retarders use hydraulic fluid to generate braking force. Both types of retarders are effective in reducing wear on traditional braking systems, especially during long descents or when carrying heavy loads. The choice between electric and hydraulic retarders depends on factors such as vehicle type, terrain, and desired braking performance.</p></p>
