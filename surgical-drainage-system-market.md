<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surgical Drainage System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Drains</li><li>Active Drains</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The surgical drainage system market includes two main types: Passive Drains and Active Drains. Passive Drains rely on gravity to remove excess fluids from the surgical site, while Active Drains use suction to facilitate drainage. Passive Drains are more commonly used in simple procedures where minimal drainage is expected, while Active Drains are preferred for more complex surgeries that require continuous or efficient drainage. Both types play a critical role in managing post-operative fluid buildup and promoting healing.</p></p>
